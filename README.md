This project is a visualisation tool that will animate the way a cipher will encrypt or decrypt different algorithms. The animation and display is similar to a retro train station board and is meant to emulate that style.  

To use the tool simply type in a message to display, the algorithm to encrypt with, and the option to encrypt / decrypt with the selected algorithm.

A key text box is used for specifying a key to encrypt with. IF DECRYPTING, the key box must be used.

To run, use command '$ npm start'
